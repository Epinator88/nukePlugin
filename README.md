# nukePlugin
Adds nukes that can be crafted, defused, and detonated to Minecraft 1.21.4 Paper servers.

Crafting a nuke is simple: TNT in the center, glowstone above, below, and next to the TNT, and gunpowder in the corners.
Detonation is simply lighting the block: it will broadcast a message to the entire server, and another one to those within blast radius.
Lighting a nuke will tell the entire server you lit one, and it will begin to glow.
### By right clicking a live nuke with a flint and steel, it can be defused back into block form.
Nuke explosions are MASSIVE, and can level bases, so be careful, and always carry a flint and steel on hand if your base is a hot topic for raids.
Done in about an hour at the request of a friend. Meant to be used on a personal minecraft server.
You are free to use this code however you want. Hell, copy it and don't credit me at all, I could not care less.

Thanks for reading!
